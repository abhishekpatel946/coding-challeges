# Coding Challenges with learning and building real-world projects

Welcome to Coding Challenges!

I provide a weekly coding challenge to help software engineers improve their skills through deliberate practice. These challenges are based on exercises that I have used or am using to learn new programming languages or technologies.

Each challenge requires you to create a tool or application, most of which are based on real-world tools and utilities. The challenges are designed to be small enough to complete in your spare time over a week or two, yet large enough to be fully functional projects.

Each challenge comes with an introduction explaining the challenge, along with a background section that provides a brief overview of any necessary background knowledge. This is followed by a detailed explanation of the challenge, as well as instructions and/or scripts to test your solution.

I value your feedback on the challenges and am always looking for ways to make them better, so please let me know how I can help you level up as a software engineer!

## Whitepapers Collection (Reading or Completed)

I have curated a selection of whitepapers for you to peruse. These documents explore some of the most cutting-edge and captivating technologies, and I personally find them invaluable in my daily work. Moreover, I enjoy sharing them with others and integrating their algorithms and workflows into my own processes.
